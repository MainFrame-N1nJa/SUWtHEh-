This site contains the files used for analysis of SecurityNik Inc.'s compromise. These are mostly the the packets and some logs. The Splunk log file is over 3GB. If you are reading the book and would like a copy or have an area I can store this 3GB file, then reach out to me at nikalleyne at gmail dot com.

NOTE: The .exe file above "Nik_in_Vegas.exe" is actually called "Pam_In_Guyana.exe" in the book. Therefore if you are going through the book, simplay replace "Pam_In_Guyana.exe" with "Nik_In_Vegas.exe".
